// Given a 2D array accounts of m x n size, accounts[j] represents money in the jth bank account of the ith customer.

// Return the wealth of the richest individual from a set of bank customers.

// Imagine every customer has multiple bank accounts, with each account holding a certain amount of money. The total wealth of a customer is calculated by summing all the money across their multiple accounts.

// Examples

// Example 1:
// Input: [[5,2,3],[0,6,7]]
// Expected Output: 13
// Justification: The total wealth of the first customer is 10 and of the second customer is 13. So, the output is 13 as itâ€™s the maximum among all customers.

// Example 2:
// Input: [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
// Expected Output: 11
// Justification: Total wealth for each customer is [3, 7, 11]. Maximum of these is 11.

// Example 3:
// Input: [[10,100],[200,20],[30,300]]
// Expected Output: 330
// Justification: Total wealth for each customer is [110, 220, 330]. The wealthiest customer has 330.
